title: Time Explained.(Wisdom)

Many are times that we sit around complaining and blaming what we lack in our lives. Sometimes it is not what we lack that limits us but rather what we have and just don't know how to use and when to use them.Ideas don't come out fully formed but they grow with time, however it is vital to overcome hesitation and get started.

> The difference between time and money is that, with money you always know how much you have left.

Everyday is a gift and the choices we make in each one can either make us or destroy us in the near future thus one should use their time wisely and choose correctly.

> We all need to escape the prisons of our own negative thoughts, jails of "i can't do it","i will do it later","its bigger than me". Doubt and fear only eats away the best of you. FIGHT those.

Let's know that time is the reason why everything doesn't happen all at once. One step at a time in the right direction always gets you somewhere better than yesterday

> Never wish to be someone else but rather a better version of yourself.You are the best.
